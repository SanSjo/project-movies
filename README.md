# Project Movies

In this week's project, we build our first multi-page React application, using API. WE learned how to pass information such as product ids, in the url and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content. We used React, JSX and CSS to build our movie website. 

The goal for this week was to use [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

When I first started the project I planned how to build the site and what componets to use, and compare to the recent project we had I now feel that I understand how to use the components and why.

If I would have more time I would have made it more responsive and I would have add a dropdown to change the list. For example, toggle between popular, upcoming, and new releases.
